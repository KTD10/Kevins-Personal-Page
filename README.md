# My Landing Page
### Week two challenge: Create a personal landing page that meets all given criteria 

## Motivation
My motivation for this project was to create a personal landing page that would show off my abilities with both HTML and CSS. This project was very challenging and rewarding, once things went the right way. I added 3 photos of myself along with facts about them to share more about myself with whom ever reads it.

## Challenges
Some challenges I faced while making this project was, quite simply, getting creative. I googled several other landing pages for inspiration and that was a mistake. Seeing what a professional with years of experience can make vs what I was able to create was laughable. But, I did come up with ideas to make this landing page personal and more fun for myself.

## Lessons Learned
After completing this project I learned a multitude of things. For example, when to ask for help. Initially I was convinced to solve all problems myself and not ask for help until the bitter end. The result: I did not complete this project until the last second. Lesson learned: ask for help when help is needed.
